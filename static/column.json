We had the whole conference area in the Bio Innovation Center to code, discuss and focus on specific topics we had on the agenda for the week. In the evenings we also found time to get together as a team and socialize: we got a special city tour through Dresden by Florian, spent an evening playing laser tag and two nights coding/relaxing with pizza. Another highlight was that Dmitri from Russia and Dominique and Samuel from Switzerland could join the sprint!"
